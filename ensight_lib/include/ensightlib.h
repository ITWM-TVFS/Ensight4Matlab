/**
 * @mainpage
 * The Ensight Library is a C++ library to handle the EnSight Gold Data Format
 * (specified by CEI software, more details http://www.ceisoftware.com/).
 *
 * The Ensight Library can be used to:
 * - read files in EnSight Gold format (Ascii and binary)
 * - write files in EnSight Gold format (Ascii and binary)
 * - represent data according to the Ensight Gold format.
 *   Data can be static (single timestep) or transient (multiple timesteps).
 * - some basic geometric algorithms like fast cell lookup based on spatial
 *   subdivision (Octree/Quadtree), which can be used for interpolation.
 *
 * Short specification of the EnSight Gold format:
 *
 * The starting point of the EnSight Gold files is the so-called <tt>case</tt>
 * file, that points to all other files including model, geometry variables, and
 * possibly measured geometry and variables. All variable results for EnSight
 * Gold format are contained in disk files - one variable per file.
 * Additionally, if there are multiple time steps, there must either be a set of
 * disk files for each time step (transient multiple-file format), or all time
 * steps of a particular variable or geometry in one disk file each (transient
 * single-file format).
 * The EnSight Case file is an ASCII free format file that contains all the file
 * and name information for accessing model (and measured) geometry, variable,
 * and time information. It is comprised of five sections (FORMAT, GEOMETRY,
 * VARIABLE, TIME, FILE).
 *
 *
 * Since the Ensight Gold specification is more general than the data exported
 * from external tools we work with, some parts are not (yet) implemented:
 * - MATERIAL SETS (MATERIAL key word is completely ignored)
 * - FILE SETS (FILE key word is completely ignored)
 * - In Variable files UNDEFINED values and PARTIAL values are not supported.
 * - Only 1 TIME SET is supported. This TIME SET must be used for all variables
 *   and all geometries. For static data simply do not define a TIME SET and
 *   call setStatic().
 * - STRUCTURED data is not supported, only unstructured data, i.e. the BLOCK
 *   keyword is completely ignored.
 *
 * Some more limitations:
 * - GEOMETRY:
 *   - Only one model (measured etc. is not supported)
 * - VARIABLE:
 *   - The following key words are supported
 *     - Scalar per Node
 *     - Constant per Case
 *     - Vector per Node
 * - FILE:
 *   - No file Fileset are supported
 *
 * Data written by this library passes the EnSight Format Checker <ens_checker>
 * validation tool.
