Thank you for taking your time to contribute!

# Code of Conduct
To keep it simple: please be considerate and respectful, behave mannerly and use your common sense.

# Contribution Guidelines
## Reporting issues

- **Search for existing issues.** Please check to see if someone else has reported the same issue.
- **Share as much information as possible.** Include operating system and version, as well as MATLAB version. Also, include steps to reproduce the bug.

## Pull requests
- Keep pull requests simple and small, do not pollute them with unintended changes.
- If your PR resolves an issue, include **closes #ISSUE_NUMBER** in your commit message (or a [synonym](https://help.github.com/articles/closing-issues-using-keywords/)).

## Code Style

Not all current code follows the conventions below but these will be followed for future developments. 
- `lowerCamelCase` variables and functions/methods.
- `UpperCamelCase` classes.
- Use descriptive variables names when possible, e.g. `partName` instead of `pn`. Short variable names are okay for local with small scope, e.g. loop variables. 
- Indent code using [Allman style](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indentation_style#Allman_style). If surrounding code significantly differs from this, consider using the style predominantly used in the file instead.
